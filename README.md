# My First Web Project

Welcome to my first web project! This project serves as a starting point for me to learn and explore web development. In this README, I will provide an overview of the project and guide you through its setup and usage.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a simple website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website will have a basic layout and some interactive elements to demonstrate fundamental web development concepts.

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. Ensure you have a compatible web browser installed, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.

## Usage

Once you have the project set up, you can open the website in your web browser by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the project's root directory.

2. Find the `index.html` file and double-click it.

   The website should open in your default web browser, and you can start exploring its features.
   
Please note that the live version hosted at [daemon192.github.io](https://daemon192.github.io) will always reflect the latest version of the project, so it's recommended to visit that link for the most up-to-date experience.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance. Enjoy exploring the project!

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
├── styles.css
├── index.html
└── README.md
```

- The `css/` directory contains the `styles.css` file, which contains the CSS rules for styling the website.

- The `index.html` file is the main HTML file that represents the structure and content of the website.
